This is an attempt to learn more about understanding and making makefiles 
derived from the following makefile tutorial: 
	https://makefiletutorial.com/#getting-started

# Exercize_00: Hello world
# Exercize_01: Makefile syntax
# Exercize_02: Targets & rules
# Exercize_03: Targets, rules and prerequisites
# Exercize_04: Variables
# Exercize_05: The all target
# Exercize_06: Multiple targets
# Exercize_07: Automatic variables & * wildcards #1//need to revisit
# Exercize_08: Automatic variables & * wildcards #2
# Exercize_09: Automatic variables
# Exercize_10: Static pattern rules manual
# Exercize_11: Static pattern rules automatic
# Exercize_12: Static pattern rules and filter/funstions
# Exercize_13: 

# stuck so trying to find more insight into makefiles via:
# https://www.cmcrossroads.com/article/makefile-optimization-shell-and-go-together
# Exercize_12.1: difference between = & :=

# which lead us into reaserching Makefiles:
# https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/make3/book/ch12.pdf
# some usefull flags for debugging Makefiles
# --justprint (-n), --print-data-base (-p), and --warn-undefined-variables
# --debug, --debug=baisc,verbose,implicit,jobs,all,makefile
# One of the most important aspects of programming robust makefiles is to check the
# return status of commands.
